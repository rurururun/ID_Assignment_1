# ID_Assignment_1
I have decided to create a website for an imaginary interest group called game club. In the website, I will display information about the interest group such as the goal of our group, type of games we play and activities/events we have held. I will also display the games that we play with a brief description for each game and images of the games. I will also display the names and photos of the members in our interest group, including their position in the interest group. I will also include a form to for the users to fill up (does not store the data after form submission).
# Design Process
This website is designed for students who are interested in joining an interest group. Before joining an interest group the students would first want to understand what the interest group is all about and in my website, which contains all the information about my interest group.
# User Story
* As a user, I can press on the About Us button, so that I can get to know more about the objective of this interest group.
* As a user, I can press on the Games button, so that I can get to know more about the games this interest group plays.
* As a user, I can press on the Members button, so that I can see who are the main personnels of this interest group.
* As a user, I can press on the Review button, so that I can give the interest group feedback on how to improve the website.
* As a user, I can press on the respective logos such as facebook, instagram or twitter in the footer, so that I can see the most recent things this interest group has done.

# Interesting bugs I have discovered during testing
1. Swapping between mobile navigation and desktop navigation caused the navigation between pages to stop working
    1. Solved it after looking through the Javascript, had to add an additional variable to store the clicking of collapse navbar icon and check using that variable instead.
